Learning bash we need to first have terminal open 

1.First CMD is "echo" it is used for printing the text
   (eg.) echo Hello world!!
  It would print "Hello world!!"

2.Now we are going to see about "cat" it is also print text 
  difference between echo and cat is echo print text are
  message while cat print full file contents

   Step 1:
          "vim 2.txt" press i to go into the insert
          mode and type what ever you want in that file 
   Step 2:
         press "esc" then use ":" type type wq and last press "Enter" 
   Step 3:
         Use cat cmd to print the file content 
         CMD:
             cat 2.txt

 ---------------------------------
# Note:                           #
#    cat is not a bash cmd it is  #
#     a external cmd. I have used #
#     here because few may not    #
#     known so it is here. In this#
#     i have covered some external#
#     cmd like this.              #
 ---------------------------------

3.We are going to run bash file with extension of ".sh" 
  
  Step 1:
        Create a file using vim "3.sh" and type the cmd 
         #! bin/bash 
         echo hello world!!

 ---------------------------------
#  The first lien tells the os    #
#  to use bash shell to run the   #
#  script                         #
 ---------------------------------
  Step 2:
        To run the file use the CMD "bash 3.sh"
